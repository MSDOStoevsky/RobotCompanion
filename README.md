The project has two directories, one for the code for Nao, and the other for Darwin.
To run Nao's scripts, change directory (cd) to "nao/", otherwise "cd" to "darwin/"

To begin running the programs, simply run:
./emote

or 

./unemote

You will be prompted to choose a number 1 - 3, which will be the piece that you wish the robot suggest to the participant.
Any choice of Y or N will choose a feedback phrase based on a (Y)success, or a (N)failure.
